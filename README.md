# Start

This is my first game in the pygame. Because of that I have given this name to the project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Requirments

To run the project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (listed below)
    - pygame=2.5.2

### Installation

If you prefer to use the precompiled executable without installation, you can skip the setup and run the __main__.exe file directly.


Follow these steps to install the required libraries:

1. Clone this project:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/umutcanekinci/start.git
    cd start
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # If you are using Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Game

To start the game, use the following command:
```sh
python __main__.py
```

## Gameplay

The objective of the game: 

* In every round, a player wiil be vampire and other one will be peasant randomly. Catch the peasant if you are the vampire, otherwise try to not be catched!
* The vampire is faster than peasants.
* Only the peasant can fire.
* I have not added an enemy ai so one player mode is not available. It should be added in future paths.
* I took musics and pictures from google searching without getting license, I know this is not legal. This is my first project so (I hope) this can be ignored.

#### Controls:

##### Player 1

* Move ==> ARROW KEYS

* Fire ==> CONTROL

##### Player 2

* Move ==> W, A, S, D

* Fire ==> SPACE
