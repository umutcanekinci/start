"""Filesystem anchors that work both from source and inside a PyInstaller bundle.

The game loads `assets/` with paths relative to the current working directory
(e.g. ``pygame.image.load("assets/images/...")``). That only holds when the
process runs from the project root.

When PyInstaller freezes the app, data files bundled via the spec's ``datas``
are unpacked next to the executable (onedir) or extracted to a temp dir
(onefile); either way their location is exposed as ``sys._MEIPASS``. To keep
the existing relative paths valid in both modes, ``__main__`` chdirs into
:func:`resource_root` at startup.
